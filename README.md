# GifyWeather

This is a quick PoC of an idea I had. What if the basic weather app was more interactive/dynamic.


## Demo

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the your own API KEYS for the followinf APIs

Here API - For geolocation and reverse geolocation

DarkSky API - For getting weather results




## Optimizations

- Code can be refactored using React.js
- Set up a middleware server that handles API calls so API Keys are not embeded in the frontend





## Tech Stack

**Client:** Javascript, Bootstrap
